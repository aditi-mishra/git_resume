There are 2 types of process -
<ul>
        <li> Independent Processes - Processes which do not share data with other processes .</li>
        <li> Cooperating Processes - Processes that shares data with other processes. </li>

</ul>
Cooperating process require Interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism.
Inter Process Communication is the mechanism by which cooperating process share data and information.

There are 2 ways by which Interprocess communication is achieved -
<ul>
        <li> Shared memory 	</li>
        <li> Message Parsing </li>
    </ul>

Let’s look at few of the important points of each .

Shared Memory
<ul>
    <li> A particular region of memory 	is shared between cooperating process. </li>
    <li> Cooperating process can exchange information by reading and writing data to this shared region. </li>
    <li> It’s faster than Memory Parsing, as Kernel is required only once, that is, setting up a shared memory . After That, kernel assistance is not required. </li>
</ul>
Message Parsing
<ul>
    <li> Communication takes place by 	exchanging messages directly between cooperating process.</li>
    <li> Easy to implement 	</li>
    <li> Useful for small amount of data. </li>
    <li> Implemented using System 	Calls, so takes more time than Shared Memory.</li>
</ul>
